# Natural Selection Simulator
A 3D simulation created in Unity to model natural selection, aimed at enhancing students' understanding of evolutionary processes. Allows users to experiment with various parameters and observe the effects on simulated populations. Completed as NEA for Computer Science A-Level.

## Prerequisites
### For Windows Users (Executable Available):
  - .exe - available in the ['Releases'](https://github.com/yonna-k/NaturalSelectionSim/releases) section
### For macOS/Linux Users (Requires Unity):
  - Unity Hub/Editor - Version 2021.3.4f1 (recommended)

## How To Run Executable For Windows
1. In the ['Releases'](https://github.com/yonna-k/NaturalSelectionSim/releases) section, download the zipped folder containing the exe file.
2. Extract files to a suitable location.
3. Double click the CompNEA.exe file to run.

## How To Download/Run Project in Unity
**Important:** The main scene is the **'Menu'** scene. Make sure to run the project from the **'Menu'** scene to access all features correctly.
1. Clone Repository
   
   <pre>git clone https://github.com/yonna-k/NaturalSelectionSim.git</pre>
2. Open the Project in Unity:
  - Launch Unity Hub.
  - Click on Add to add the project from disk.
  - Navigate to the cloned repository folder and select it.
3. Run the Application:
  - In the Unity Editor, go to the Project window.
  - Navigate to `Assets > Scenes`.

## Additional Notes

This project was my first attempt at implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Unity. Since then, I have continued to improve my skills through my studies in university and have learnt a lot more about OOP and coding in general.
